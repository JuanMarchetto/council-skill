## Important: This skill provides structured thinking frameworks, not professional advice. For medical, legal, or financial decisions, always consult qualified professionals.

# Council — Life Advisory Council

Coordinate 8 specialist advisors to analyze any life topic from multiple angles simultaneously. Each advisor brings domain expertise, then a synthesizer resolves conflicts and produces a unified, prioritized action plan.

## How It Works

1. **Topic Analysis** — determines which advisors (3-8) are relevant
2. **Advisor Selection** — picks from the full roster:
   - **Life Coach**: always included (holistic perspective, values alignment)
   - **Finance**: budget, investments, debt strategy
   - **Health**: physical, mental, nutrition, sleep
   - **Career**: development, networking, positioning
   - **Learning**: skill acquisition, courses, deliberate practice
   - **Systems**: time management, workflows, automation
   - **Relationships**: communication, social dynamics, community
   - **Creative**: innovation, projects, aesthetics
3. **Parallel Dispatch** — launches advisors simultaneously using agent files in `agents/`
4. **Synthesis** — `agents/advisor-synthesizer.md` resolves conflicts, finds synergies, produces unified output

## Output

- **Council Summary** — holistic overview
- **Key Synergies** — actions serving multiple domains
- **Prioritized Action Plan** — max 7 focused actions
- **Watch List** — monitor but don't act yet
- **Recommended Follow-ups** — which advisors to consult individually

## Example Output

```
## Prioritized Action Plan
1. **Career**: Start networking in target industry (Career Advisor: 8/10 urgency)
2. **Finance**: Build 6-month runway before transition (Finance Advisor: 9/10 urgency)
3. **Health**: Establish stress management routine (Health Advisor: 7/10 urgency)
4. **Relationships**: Communicate plans with partner (Relationships Advisor: 8/10 urgency)

Advisor Consensus: 6/8 advisors support the transition with conditions.
Key Conflict: Finance says "wait 6 months", Career says "move now" — Synthesizer recommends staged approach.
```

## Usage

```
"I'm considering a career change — convene the council"
"Help me plan my finances for the next quarter"
"I need to optimize my daily routines and productivity"
"Review my progress across all life domains"
"organize my life"
"what should I focus on"
"I need advice about..."
"quarterly review"
```
